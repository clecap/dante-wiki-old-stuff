# Dantewiki

**Dantewiki** is a personal mediawiki on steroids. It supports user-friendly exchange of ideas.


## Core Concepts

The core ideas are as follows:

* **Ease of installation**: A dantewiki can be set up and configured in a matter of seconds. Don't think of a dantewiki as a large system which might 
  take hours of sweat for installing and configuring as this is the case with 
  a fully grown Mediawiki installation.
* **Lightweight**: A dantewiki is light-weight: You will have several of them at the same time for different purposes. It is not a large wikipedia-like 
  system but rather your own notebook. 
* **Ease of operation**: Being light-weight, you can treat a dantewiki as a simple file. You can copy them, duplicate them and move them around easily.
* **Ease of use**: Dantewiki is based on mediawiki with several extensions,
  some of which specifically written for dantewiki. Thus, you enjoy the standard interface of wikipedia without the hassle of
  complex installation and maintenance.
